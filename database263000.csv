Small TownÂ® Brewery Not Your Father'sÂ® Ginger Ale.Must be +21 to purchase.Ale brewed 5.9% alcohol by volume with ginger.5.9% Alc/vol.See bottom panel for flavor profile.

Other Description
My great-great-grandfather from the 1600s was the captain of a ship in England. He was also a bit of a gambler. As legend has it, he won a brewery during a high-stakes card game, which led him to start crafting his own beers. He began brewing beer on the ships he sailed. This allowed him to travel further than other vessels because beer stayed fresh during long journeys. The story goes that his beer was even consumed on a fleet of ships he commanded that transported some of the earliest settlers to America.Growing up, I was told that my great-great-grandfather was a ship captain, but I never heard the complete story until I expressed an interest in making my own beer. When I told my mom that I planned to open a brewery, she finally revealed my family's beer making history and why brewing was ""in my blood"". Using some of my great-great-grandfather's recipes as inspiration, I founded Small Town Brewery. At Small Town, our goal is to honor my family's beer making tradition by brewing specialty beers with unique and flavorful ingredients.Tim Kovac, Founder & brewmaster.This is beer flavored with spices.We like to think of it as a refreshing ale brewed with ginger.Small Town brewery makes specialty beers that utilize.Unique ingredients with an unmistakable taste of nostalgia.

","Vosges Black Salt Caramel Bar 70% Cacao :: Directions for Me


Description
VosgesÂ® Black Salt Caramel Bar 70% Cacao.Haut chocolate.Black Hawaiian sea salt.Burnt sugar caramel.Dark chocolate.Fair Trade Certifiedâ„¢ ingredients.GMO free.GF, gluten free.

Other Description
How to enjoy an exotic chocolate bar: Breathe... Engage your senses. Take three deep ujjayi breaths, quiet the chattering mind and be in the present moment.See... There should be a glossy shine to the chocolate bar indicating a tight bond between the cocoa butter and the cocoa mass.Smell... Rub your thumb on the chocolate bar's surface to help release the fruity, cacao laden aromas. Inhale deeply.Snap... Break the bar in two pieces. Listen to the soft break, exposing the chocolate bar's molten caramel interior.Taste... Place a small piece of chocolate on your tongue and press it to the roof of your mouth. Within thirty seconds the chocolate square will melt, releasing a bouquet of rich burnt caramel notes with the essence of black Hawaiian salt.Black Hawaiian salt or Hiwa Kai is a blend of sea salt and volcanic charcoal. The salt is harvested naturally in ocean pools that have formed from past volcanic eruptions. The salt's striking obsidian hue is matched only by its flavor on your palate - slightly nutty and smoky-the perfect combination with caramel and dark chocolate.Peace, Love, and ChocolateÂ®.Katrina.After graduating from Vanderbilt University, Katrina attended Le Cordon Bleu in Paris and then furthered her food studies through extensive world travel.

","Stoner Invisible Glass Premium Glass Cleaner :: Directions for Me


Directions
Read entire label before using.1. For streak-free glass cleaning, it is important to use a proper applicator. Use only soft, clean, lint-free cloths or towels that are free of residual detergents and fabric softeners that can streak glass. Avoid paper towels that contain streaky wetting agents. Some pros prefer crumpled newspaper.2. Hold can 8 to 10 inches from surface to be sprayed. For most applications, apply a thin coating on the surface.3. Gently wipe surface to lift and remove grime.For best results, two or more applications may be necessary, and glass must be dried completely with a towel or cloth. First applications will remove the majority of dirt and grime but trace residues of solubilized dirt may remain.A second or third application with a clean cloth may be needed to loosen and absorb these trace deposits for complete cleaning.Invisible Glass is powerful, yet harmless to glass and many other surfaces. Before using, always test for suitability in a small, out-of-sight area. Always follow equipment manufacturers cleaning instructions. Not recommended for plastics or surfaces that could be damaged by water or solvents. Discard if not used by ""use by month/year"" date on bottom of can.

New Invisible Glass reach & clean tool.Clean glass faster.Video & offers online.See it work at newglasstoolvideo.com.Cleans glass so well, you'll think it's invisible.Invisible Glass was developed with two simple objectives: superior cleaning power and ""invisible"" clarity. When you compare Invisible Glass to ordinary ""blue water"" glass cleaners, you'll immediately see how quickly it removes even the most difficult grime, making glass virtually ""disappear"". Use Invisible Glass to clean windows, mirrors, windshields, and other glass surfaces at home, work, and play.Invisible Glass is engineered with a multi-component formula that is more powerful than other glass cleaners. It quickly removes oily dirt, dust, fingerprints, sap, bugs, droppings, grease, adhesives, smudges, smoke haze, plasticizer film, pollutants, and other difficult grime.Other glass cleaners contain dyes, scents, soaps, and water. These inexpensive ingredients often remove just basic dirt and leave streaky residue which is difficult or impossible to remove. Invisible Glass contains no soaps, foams, scents, or dyes. It evaporates quickly and completely, leaving glass clean and clear with no streaks, haze, or residue.Safe to use on original equipment manufactured (OEM) and most after-market tinted windows when used as directed.

Place your dog on the pad so that your dog can smell the pad and become accustomed to the pad's special scent.5. Continue to keep a pad in the same area so the dog will know where to wet.6. If your dog has an accident off the pad, take your dog back to the pad as soon as possible to reinforce that this is where your dog should wet.7. After your dog wets on the pad, dispose of the pad and replace it with a fresh pad at the same spot.8. Once your dog begins to use the pad on a regular basis, you can train your dog to wet outside by placing a pad outside and following the same steps above.Usage tips: pads can also be used for:Lining crates and dog carriers.Cleaning and drying wet and muddy paws.Protecting car seats.

Other Description
My great-great-grandfather from the 1600s was the captain of a ship in England. He was also a bit of a gambler. As legend has it, he won a brewery during a high-stakes card game, which led him to start crafting his own beers. He began brewing beer on the ships he sailed. This allowed him to travel further than other vessels because beer stayed fresh during long journeys. The story goes that his beer was even consumed on a fleet of ships he commanded that transported some of the earliest settlers to America.Growing up, I was told that my great-great-grandfather was a ship captain, but I never heard the complete story until I expressed an interest in making my own beer. When I told my mom that I planned to open a brewery, she finally revealed my family's beer making history and why brewing was ""in my blood"". Using some of my great-great-grandfather's recipes as inspiration, I founded Small Town Brewery. At Small Town, our goal is to honor my family's beer making tradition by brewing specialty beers with unique and flavorful ingredients.Tim Kovac, Founder & brewmaster.This is beer flavored with spices.We like to think of it as a refreshing ale brewed with ginger.Small Town brewery makes specialty beers that utilize.Unique ingredients with an unmistakable taste of nostalgia.

Small TownÂ® Brewery Not Your Father'sÂ® Ginger Ale.Must be +21 to purchase.Ale brewed 5.9% alcohol by volume with ginger.5.9% Alc/vol.See bottom panel for flavor profile.

Other Description
My great-great-grandfather from the 1600s was the captain of a ship in England. He was also a bit of a gambler. As legend has it, he won a brewery during a high-stakes card game, which led him to start crafting his own beers. He began brewing beer on the ships he sailed. This allowed him to travel further than other vessels because beer stayed fresh during long journeys. The story goes that his beer was even consumed on a fleet of ships he commanded that transported some of the earliest settlers to America.Growing up, I was told that my great-great-grandfather was a ship captain, but I never heard the complete story until I expressed an interest in making my own beer. When I told my mom that I planned to open a brewery, she finally revealed my family's beer making history and why brewing was ""in my blood"". Using some of my great-great-grandfather's recipes as inspiration, I founded Small Town Brewery. At Small Town, our goal is to honor my family's beer making tradition by brewing specialty beers with unique and flavorful ingredients.Tim Kovac, Founder & brewmaster.This is beer flavored with spices.We like to think of it as a refreshing ale brewed with ginger.Small Town brewery makes specialty beers that utilize.Unique ingredients with an unmistakable taste of nostalgia.

","Stoner Invisible Glass Premium Glass Cleaner :: Directions for Me


Directions
Read entire label before using.1. For streak-free glass cleaning, it is important to use a proper applicator. Use only soft, clean, lint-free cloths or towels that are free of residual detergents and fabric softeners that can streak glass. Avoid paper towels that contain streaky wetting agents. Some pros prefer crumpled newspaper.2. Hold can 8 to 10 inches from surface to be sprayed. For most applications, apply a thin coating on the surface.3. Gently wipe surface to lift and remove grime.For best results, two or more applications may be necessary, and glass must be dried completely with a towel or cloth. First applications will remove the majority of dirt and grime but trace residues of solubilized dirt may remain.A second or third application with a clean cloth may be needed to loosen and absorb these trace deposits for complete cleaning.Invisible Glass is powerful, yet harmless to glass and many other surfaces. Before using, always test for suitability in a small, out-of-sight area. Always follow equipment manufacturers cleaning instructions. Not recommended for plastics or surfaces that could be damaged by water or solvents. Discard if not used by ""use by month/year"" date on bottom of can.

It evaporates quickly and completely, leaving glass clean and clear with no streaks, haze, or residue.Safe to use on original equipment manufactured (OEM) and most after-market tinted windows when used as directed.
